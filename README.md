## Hi, I'm Worood 👋

I love software engineering because I get to build things and turn ideas into real, working products.  


#### Frontend developer based in Saudi Arabia  

My main tech stack includes:
- **React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS**, with experience using **Django** on the backend.

   

Always learning, improving my frontend skills, and building projects to grow as a developer.  

In my free time, I enjoy **reading** and **learning new languages**.
